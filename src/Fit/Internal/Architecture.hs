FIT files can contain values encoded with both little-endian and big-endian orderings, and this
can vary throughout the file. This module provides some helper types for using parsers
with the correct endian-ness during the parse. See the "Fit.Internal.Numbers" and
"Fit.Internal.FitParser" modules for example use.
