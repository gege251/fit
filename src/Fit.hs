{- $messages
 A high-level view of a FIT file as a sequence of data messages. This is the
 recommended API for pulling information out of a FIT file, but if you need
 access to the exact structure of the file you can use the API in "Fit.Internal.FitFile" and "Fit.Internal.Parse".

 Some basic lenses are also provided for working with the Messages API. These
 can make it much easier to extract information from a FIT file, especially
 since you usually know what sort of data you're expecting to find.

 For example, from the FIT global profile we can find that the global message
 number for 'record' messages is 20, and within a `record` message the 'speed'
 field has field number 6. The following code gets the `speed` field from all
 'record' messages in the file:

 @
 Right fit <- readFileMessages "file.fit"
 let speeds = fit ^.. message 20 . field 6 . int
 -- speeds :: [Int]
 @

 Note that this package doesn't provide any lens combinators (like @(^..)@),
 so you'll need to use ones from a lens package.
